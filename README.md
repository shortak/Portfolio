# About me
Hi! I’m a Biomedical Engineering student at the University of Colorado Boulder with a passion for both biomedical and electrical engineering. I’ve worked on everything from prototyping medical devices to designing circuits and PCBs.

I love tackling technical challenges, especially relating to programming and prototyping. If you don't find me holed up in a lab, you'll find me working on other passion projects to devlop new skills or hone existing ones.

The best way to reach out to me is via email, I look forward to hearing from you!
