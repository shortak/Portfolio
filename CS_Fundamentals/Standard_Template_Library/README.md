# Overview

After grasping the concepts of [arrays](../Array/) programmers can then move onto the wonderful world of the Standard Template Library (STL) containers. 

One observation that a beginner may have noticed is that as useful as arrays are, there must be more efficient ways to create complex datasets given the wide range of possible use-cases for arrays. 

STL containers offer just that; A wide variety of containers with their own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to information access and container manipulation.

Additionally, there are a wide variety of 

# STL Functions

The STL library comes with a set of functions designed to work with the STL containers.

A list and description of every single STL function or algorithm would be massive and difficult for one person to complete. However, since most of the STL functions and algorithms work the same, I'll leave a helpful link [here](https://hackingcpp.com/cpp/cheat_sheets.html#hfold2a)

For some specific examples of these function, [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-magicians-stl-algorithms/) has great section

# Types of Containers
## Sequence Containers

Sequence Containers store collections of elements in a linear sequence - like an array, list or vector. These elements are ordered by position, not by key or value.

Key traits:

- Maintain order of insertion
- Allow duplicates
- Provide access via iterators (some can allow random-access)
- Support fast insertion/ removal at ends or middle

## Associative (sorted) Containers



## Unordered (hash-based) Containers
