# Overview

This directory will contain all my learnings, implementations as well as strategies involving linked lists and linked list algorithms. The aim of this directory is break down the structure in such a way that the reader will be able to gain an intuition on how to implement linked list algorithms. We will begin with a discussion about the data structure itself, then move onto their language-specific implementations.
