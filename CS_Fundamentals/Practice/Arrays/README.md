# Removing Dupes
Relevant files: [remove_dupes_from_sorted_array_atmpt1.cpp](remove_dupes_from_sorted_array_atmpt1.cpp) and [remove_dupes_from_sorted_aray_atmpt2](remove_dupes_from_sorted_array_atmpt2.cpp)

Both files are viable and get the job done... However, attempt 2 offers a much more efficient and faster method. The time complexity of the first is O[n^2] which the second is O[1].
